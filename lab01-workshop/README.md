Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Lab 1 in Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to complete partial code, implement and test a Python program, called `isPrime.py`, that will go through a list of numbers from the text file and determine if each one is a prime number. For this assignment, the programmer must implement a method that checks if a particular number is prime. The programmer is also responsible for testing the program to ensure it satisfies the required output.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details about the steps that a programmer should take to complete this assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review Chapters 1 and 2 of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Commands and Output

To run the program you should type `python3 isPrime.py` from the `src/` directory.

Running the program produces the following output for the instructor's version of `isPrime`. The portions of the output have been
trimmed in the display below. Your actual output will differ as it will use different numbers from those shown below.

```
 Number of values in file   :  700
 Number of primes           :  59
 Number of composites        :  641
```

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
